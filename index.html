  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hello! I'm Nathaniel, a second-year Applied Cybersecurity Major.</p>
  <p>My interests include: listening to and making music, reading, and doing as little as possible :P</p>
  <p>I have a couple years of experience with Java, about half a year with Python, and some knowledge on Data Structures.</p>
  <p>I'm hoping, by the end of this class, to be proficient with HTML and possibly start learning JavaScript and tools such as React.</p>
